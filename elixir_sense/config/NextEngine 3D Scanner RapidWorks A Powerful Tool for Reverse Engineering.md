# NextEngine 3D Scanner RapidWorks: A Powerful Tool for Reverse Engineering
 
If you are looking for a way to create parametric solid models from scanned points, you might want to consider the NextEngine 3D Scanner RapidWorks software. This software is designed to work with the NextEngine 3D Scanner, a desktop laser scanner that can capture high-resolution and full-color data of objects up to 11" x 11".

The NextEngine 3D Scanner RapidWorks software is based on Rapidform's flagship product, XOR, which sells for $20,000. It has a rich set of smart tools that can automatically recognize features in the scanned part, such as fillets, sketches, and constraints. It can also process very large data sets (10M+ points) and export the model as a native SLDPRT file in SolidWorks 2007+.
 
The NextEngine 3D Scanner RapidWorks software is ideal for reverse engineering applications, such as creating CAD models of existing parts, prototypes, or products. It can handle complex shapes and preserve the detail and resolution of the scan data. It also has a fast learning curve for users who have CAD experience, especially SolidWorks experience.
 
However, the NextEngine 3D Scanner RapidWorks software is not a cheap solution. It costs $2,495 and requires a NextEngine 3D Scanner, which costs almost $3,000. It also requires a license activation from the NextEngine website, which may not be available if the company goes out of business or stops supporting the software. Furthermore, the software is not a simple 'click and save' process. It still requires some manual editing and alignment of the scan data to create a solid model.
 
Therefore, if you are looking for a budget-friendly and easy-to-use 3D scanning solution, you might want to look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a powerful and professional tool for reverse engineering, you might want to give the NextEngine 3D Scanner RapidWorks software a try.
  
To use the NextEngine 3D Scanner RapidWorks software, you need to first scan your object with the NextEngine 3D Scanner. The scanner uses a combination of lasers and cameras to collect profile data and create a 3D point cloud. You can scan your object from multiple angles and use the automated rotating platform to capture 360 degrees of data. The scanner can also capture full-color textures and intricate geometries with an accuracy of up to 0.005 mm.
 
Once you have scanned your object, you need to import the scan data into the NextEngine 3D Scanner RapidWorks software. The software will automatically align and fuse the multiple scans into a single mesh. You can then use the smart tools to create a parametric solid model from the mesh. The software can recognize features such as planes, cylinders, spheres, extrusions, revolutions, and sweeps. You can also edit the features by modifying the sketches, constraints, dimensions, and parameters.
 
When you are satisfied with your solid model, you can export it as a native SLDPRT file in SolidWorks 2007+. You can then open the file in SolidWorks and continue to modify or analyze it as you wish. You can also export the model as other file formats, such as STL, OBJ, PLY, or VRML, for 3D printing or other applications.
