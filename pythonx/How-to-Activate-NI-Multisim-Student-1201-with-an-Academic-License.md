## Determine the type of academic license you have
 
There are two types of academic licenses that can be used to activate NI Multisim Student 12.0.1: Student Install Option (SIO) and User-Based Licensing. You need to contact your software administrator or IT staff to find out which one applies to you.
 
### Student Install Option (SIO)
 
If you have an SIO license, you need to request an SIO serial number from your software administrator or IT staff. They may need to contact NI if they cannot find the serial number or if they are not sure whether they have an Academic Volume License (AVL). Note that NI support team cannot and will not give serial numbers nor activation codes directly to students[^1^] [^4^].
 
### User-Based Licensing
 
If you have a User-Based Licensing license, you need to contact your software administrator or IT staff and provide the requested information, which may include:
 
- Your full name.
- The software you want to download and activate.
- Computer ID (in case offline activation is needed).

They will then give you a license to activate NI Multisim Student 12.0.1[^1^].
 
## Download and install NI Multisim Student 12.0.1
 
You can download NI Multisim Student 12.0.1 from the ni.com website or through NI Package Manager . You need to download NI Circuit Design Suite Education Edition , which includes both Multisim and Ultiboard[^2^].
 
## Activate NI Multisim Student 12.0.1
 
After installation, you need to activate NI Multisim Student 12.0.1 depending on the type of license you have.
 
### Student Install Option (SIO)
 
If you have an SIO license, you need to follow the Serial Number Activation steps in Activating NI Software with a Single-Seat License . You will need to enter the SIO serial number that you obtained from your software administrator or IT staff and sign in with your NI User account[^2^].
 
### User-Based Licensing
 
If you have a User-Based Licensing license, you need to follow the steps in Activate NI Software as Part of a Volume License Agreement . You will need to connect to your school's Volume License Server using the license that you obtained from your software administrator or IT staff[^2^].
 
## Enjoy using NI Multisim Student 12.0.1
 
Once you have activated NI Multisim Student 12.0.1, you can start using it for your circuit design and simulation projects. The Student Install Option licenses automatically expire after one year, so you may need to contact your software administrator or IT staff again to renew your license with a new serial number[^1^]. The User-Based Licensing licenses depend on your school's agreement with NI, so you may need to check with your software administrator or IT staff for the expiration date[^2^].
